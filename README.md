# PROJECT TITLE
Configured Performance Instrument created as an approach to experiemnting with improvised sound art performances. 

## Short Description
Configured Performance Instrument (CPI) is a project that was built upon a set of rules taken from a performance process. Its conceptual task is to find a way to connect between sound and drawing, as well as its relation to chance and improvisation. The instrument consists of nameless independent shapes on screen that have their own memories (sound) floating around and can be encountered by the user.
